      An introduction to the urban design of Amsterdam
    </h2>
    <p>
      From small towns to major cities, urban infrastructures impact the lives of citizens
      and the entire economies of municipalities. Yet, countless municipalities have
      scarred their cities with car-centric urban infrastructures, resulting in car
      dependency, reduced health and happiness of citizens, weaker economies and
      increasing infrastructure costs.
      <br>
      It doesnâ€™t have to be like this. Throughout the 60s, Amsterdam was a majorly
      car-centric city. This changed with urban design reforms following protests from
      citizens. The goal of this open guide is to have you explore Amsterdam as a local
      would, with one key takeaway: Amsterdam is not a special case, any city can and
      should free itself from the shackles of car dependency.
